# Web Application for Monitoring Student Progress - [Slovenian README](README_SLO.md)
This application was developed as a project for the final assignment in a high school computer science program.  

The application is designed as an online app to improve communication between teachers and students and to more effectively monitor students' academic progress. 
It is primarily intended for teachers who wish to have a simple and transparent way of recording student activities, enabling them to better adapt to the needs of individual students and provide better learning support.

## Technologies  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- PHP  
- Javascript  
- MySQL  
- Bootstrap  
- CodeIgniter

## Key Features  
1. **Monitoring Student Activities:**  
   - The application allows teachers to track the projects and assignments that students complete within the curriculum. The teacher can record individual participation, progress, special considerations, or challenges a student may face for each project.  
2. **Creating and Editing Projects:**  
   - Teachers can create new projects for students in the application. Each project can be described in detail, and evaluation criteria can be set. The teacher can modify the project as needed.  
3. **Project Evaluation:**  
   - Once a student completes a project, the teacher enters a grade and records any comments on the student's work. This helps with objective and traceable progress assessment and provides feedback that can help students improve.  
4. **Class Teacher Overview:**  
   - Class teachers have special access to the projects of all students in their class. This allows for better coordination and monitoring of the overall class progress. The class teacher can observe activities, spot potential issues, and proactively assist students in achieving their goals.  
5. **User Management for Administrators:**  
   - Administrators have access to user settings and can manage user permissions (assign roles, add or remove users). They ensure that permissions are aligned with the needs of teachers, class teachers, and other application users.  

## Advantages  
1. **Centralized Progress Overview:**  
   - The application provides teachers and class teachers with centralized access to all student projects and assignments, making it much easier to track their progress.  
2. **Better Communication and Adaptation:**  
   - With an overview of recorded data, teachers can adjust their teaching methods based on students' specific needs, contributing to an improved learning process and better academic success.  
3. **Simplification of Administrative Work:**  
   - The application reduces the amount of administrative work by organizing all information about students and projects in one place, allowing teachers to access data quickly and track progress efficiently.  

## Goal  
The main goal of the application is to improve the overview of student activities and progress and allow teachers to effectively monitor projects. This encourages better collaboration between teachers and students and allows for the timely recognition of issues, with teachers being able to adjust their support to improve academic results.
